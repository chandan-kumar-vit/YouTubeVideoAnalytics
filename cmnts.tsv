64	No one fucking cares. You're a 12 year old. There comes a point where you're too old for the whole I'm so goofy and fun every second of every day schtick. Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge.	0

101	Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine	0
102	I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.	0
103	Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you	0
104	You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired..	0
105	Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man	0
106	Never apologise to the regressives	0
107	dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah	0
108	Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration	0
109	PROCEED WITH CAUTION: \nThis comment section will give you stage 4 cancer immediately.	0
110	this isn't a bad thing... shit happens	0
111	I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.	0
112	And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.	1
113	What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️	0
114	OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist.	0
115	pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.	0
116	I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well	0
117	Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller	0
118	Y'all will forgive him for anything lol	0
119	i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..	0
120	I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!	0
121	HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN.	0
122	i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.	0
123	I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident	0
124	I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads	0
125	People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it	0
126	Its just a word, calm down	0
127	lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front	0
128	To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD	0
129	So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans.	0
130	👈 watch by clicking here people's are entertaining	1
131	Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened.	0
132	What did he say??	0
133	Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/	0
134	If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period	0
135	I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.	0
136	Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me	0
137	Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao	0
138	I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves	0
139	Social justice warriors need to chill	0
140	As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)	0
141	Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example	0
142	say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much	0
143	Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix	0
144	If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video.	0
145	Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke.	0
146	It's okay man👌👌	0
147	Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again?	0
148	The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU?	0

164	Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives.	0
165	Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!	0
166	Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf	0
167	I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell.	0
168	Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it.	0
169	You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did.	0
170	All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters.	0
171	Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word	0

211	Let time and technology turned iPhone X cheaper. For now I'll settle down with my secondhanded 6s. I have skipped 7 anyway and definitely won't buy 8.	0
212	How are Chinese going to secure their phones???	0
213	The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1,000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now.	0
214	1,000 ?! . No thank you . Great phone tho . You know how many things I can buy with that	0
215	I'm not an apple fan, had iPhones for years in the past before being overcome with boredom stemming from the stagnant design and underwhelming yearly reveals. Currently loving on my gorgeous s8 plus, HOWEVER, the iPhone X is absolutely beautiful, and for the first time in years I'm actually kind of excited about an apple product. Also can't wait to see how Samsung responds, competition means better products for consumers. Nice work apple:)	0

243	That's the 8 the iPhone x is different	0
244	To me, it's just a waste of money. Samsung galaxy note 8 is better	0
245	If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook.	0
246	If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor.	0

257	apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins....	0

367	You know  you'll buy it. We'll all buy it. Damn you Apple! But seriously why buy an iPhone 8 when it's almost exactly like an iPhone 7 but slight with 2 more nucleus. Save money for iPhone X or better yet , save your money and in 2 more years the price will drop enough to buy it, after the new iPhone XI, XII, XII, XX come out.	0

546	Paul Ryan has not yet come to terms with the fact that Ayn Rand is power pornography for teenage boys at a certain stage of aching virginity -- and normal kids get over it.\n \nA lot of people throughout RepublicanLand have variations on the same problem.  They really believe a scientifically incorrect notion, that human beings are independent of one another.  It may feel like that for the lonely teenager, but it's never, ever, true.  \n \nFrom that falsehood, they then build up moralities, generally ugly, histories, false, and a subset of both: self-serving aims or purpose.\n\nThis high-minded purpose gives us a HUD Secretary who is opposed to the Department of HUD, a Secretary of Health (named Price!) who believes that all medicine should be commercial.  You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.  All with the highest moralities he's been able to find anywhere! \n \nThe good Doctor Carson is really, really, one of the gang.\n\n-dlj.	0

That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8.

609	Look at all these poor Shitsung folks in the comments... Putting personal preference aside, no matter how you slice it, Apple will come out with the new best-selling phone on the market, again. It will be the fastest phone on the market, again. It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world. Can't argue with facts people. BUT, I'm sure you'll find a way!	0

902	So I used to live right in front of the tour room aka mint condition room. Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates.	1
